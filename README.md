# DriveAhead F1 Analytics Platform

An interactive Formula 1 analytics and probability engine that combines real-time data, machine learning insights, and professional F1 broadcast styling. Perfect for fans, students, and developers interested in sports analytics and ML applications.

## Overview

DriveAhead is an F1 analytics system that demonstrates how machine learning interprets racing data to calculate win probabilities. Using three powerful algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression), it provides probability-based insights derived from current championship standings, recent performance, and driver statistics.

**Note**: This project calculates statistical probabilities, not certainties. F1 racing remains unpredictable due to strategy, weather, mechanical factors, and driver performance variations—which is what makes the sport exciting!

- Git

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lesliefdo08/DriveAheadF1.git
   cd DriveAheadF1
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   
   # Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd website
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the platform**
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

## Machine Learning Training

The platform uses an optimized ML training system that trains three algorithms and intelligently saves only the best-performing models.

### Train Models

```bash
python train_models_clean.py
```

### Training Process
- Generates 3000 realistic F1 training samples
- Trains Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression
- Evaluates using MAE (position) and Accuracy (winner/podium)
- Saves only the 3 best models plus scaler and encoders

### Model Performance
- Position Prediction: MAE < 1.4
- Winner Prediction: 97%+ accuracy
- Podium Prediction: 95%+ accuracy

3. Saves ONLY the best-performing model for each task
4. Results in 60-70% reduction in storage usage

**Impact**:
- Storage: ~50MB to ~20MB per training session
- Files saved: 8 models to 3 models + 2 supporting files
- Performance: Maintained at 97%+ accuracy

## Performance Features

- Optimized Assets: Minified CSS and efficient JavaScript

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   netstat -ano | findstr :5000
   taskkill /PID <process_id> /F
   ```

2. **Module not found errors**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

3. **API rate limiting**
   - Implement caching to reduce API calls
   - Use fallback data when API is unavailable
